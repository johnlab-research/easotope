## Easotope
### Making Stable Isotope Analysis Easy

#### Introduction
Easotope is free software written in Java. Easotope was conceived and written by [CÃ©dric John](https://github.com/cedricmjohn) and Devon Bowen. This repo is a fork of the [official Easotope GitHub repository](https://github.com/Easotope/easotope) where the primary version of this code resides.

With Easotope, you can easily open files from mass spectromers vendors, automatically process the data, and correct it. 
Easotope is [available as an executable](https://www.easotope.org/) as well as source code. The code is written in Java under the Eclipse framework.
