## Easotope
### Making Stable Isotope Analysis Easy

#### Introduction
Easotope is free software written in Java. With Easotope, you can easily open files from mass spectromers vendors, automatically process the data, and correct it. Easotope is available as an executable as well as source code. Read the paper for further details, or visit the Easotope website.
Easotope is the co-creation of [CÃ©dric John](https://github.com/cedricmjohn)  and Devon Bowen. This is a fork of the [official Easotope GitHub repository](https://github.com/Easotope/easotope) where the primary version of this code resides.
The code is written in Java under the Eclipse framework. Compiled version of the software [can be found here](https://www.easotope.org/).
